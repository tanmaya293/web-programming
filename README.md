Project Title: Craigslist
Name of the Website: Craigslist
Project Description:
Craigslist provides a user to register on the website following which the page is redirected to a series of products available to add to Wishlist. The user is free to add products to the database. Searching and categorizing products have been implemented in such a way that they work together to give a better form of result filtering. The user can also add images at the same time to any product. The admin plays a bit larger role which includes adding, editing and soft-deleting products. During soft delete the data remains in the database but the user or admin does not see it on the website. The Wishlist is maintained by every user individually and will have the products enlisted even if soft delete has been operated on them.
